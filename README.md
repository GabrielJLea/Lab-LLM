---

### Text or HTML Files

```bash
python3 docusm.py <name of local txt or html file>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
python3 docusm.py declaration.txt
The Declaration of Independence asserts that the thirteen united colonies have the right to sever ties with Great Britain and establish themselves as independent states. This decision is based on the belief that the British government has repeatedly abused and usurped the rights of the colonies, leading to a breakdown in the relationship between the two. The document goes on to list a series of grievances against King George III and the British government, concluding that the colonies must now take control of their own destinies and govern themselves as independent nations.

### PDF Files

```bash
python3 docusm.py <pdf file name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
python3 docusm.py research_paper.pdf
The research paper proposes a novel unsupervised pretraining method called DOCSPLIT, designed to improve the representation of large documents. DOCSPLIT uses contrastive learning to force models to consider the entire global context of a document, outperforming existing methods on various downstream tasks. The authors demonstrate significant improvements on document classification, few-shot learning, and document retrieval tasks using DOCSPLIT-pretrained models.

The text appears to be a collection of JavaScript and CSS code, as well as news articles and headlines from a Spanish-language news website, El Pa√≠s. The code includes settings, configurations, and styles for a web application, while the articles cover a range of topics including politics, sports, economy, and culture. The text also includes references to specific CSS files, fonts, and layout information, suggesting that it is part of a web design project or online application.
